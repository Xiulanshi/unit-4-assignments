Question 1: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/minimum-draws

Copy and paste your code: 

let firstLine = Int(readLine(stripNewline: true)!)!
for _ in 1...firstLine{
let totalPairOfSocks = Int(readLine(stripNewline: true)!)!
print(totalPairOfSocks+1)
}

//In its worst case scenario, n+1 socks (x) should Jim remove from his drawer until he finds a matching pair if there are n pairs socks in total.

What is the big O runtime of your code?: O(n)

Question 2: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/handshake

Copy and paste your code:

let firstLine = Int(readLine(stripNewline: true)!)!
for _ in 1...firstLine{
let numberOfPeople = Int(readLine(stripNewline: true)!)!
print(numberOfPeople*(numberOfPeople - 1)/2)
}

// n*(n-1)/2 which is simplified from C(n, 2) 

What is the big O runtime of your code?: O(n^2)
